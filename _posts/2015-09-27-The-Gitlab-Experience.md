title: The Gitlab Experience

[Gitlab](https://about.gitlab.com/gitlab-com/) is a Git repository manager, very similar to [Github](https://github.com/) but with advantages of its own. You can reference the "[better-than-github](https://about.gitlab.com/better-than-github/)" article for more details of its advantages. I'm sure the article is biased, being written by Gitlab, but since this post is about my experience with gitlab you will have to do the research yourself to decide which Git repository manager is for you. Here is a great list of [self hosted git repository managers](http://www.slant.co/topics/1440/~what-are-the-best-self-hosted-web-based-git-repository-managers) with pros and cons.
